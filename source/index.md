# Introduction
Welcome to the Ramen API.

<aside class="warning">
__We're in the process of building out the API. These docs serve as the medium to
discuss the technical API implementation before coding it up.__
</aside>

We're using our own product (Ramen!) to plan out the API's features and functionality. 
We'd love to get your input so we can build a powerful yet simple API. 
Join us here, [the Ramen API Project](https://align.ramen.is/projects/api/kitchen).
