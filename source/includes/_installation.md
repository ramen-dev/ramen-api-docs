### Enable Secure Mode **<small>(Optional)</small>**

Once you've verified Ramen is enabled, you may want to enable Secure Mode.

**Secure Mode** ensures that nobody can pretend to be your customers. Enabling
**Secure Mode** requires some changes that a developer will have to make in your
Segment.com `analytics.js` code.
