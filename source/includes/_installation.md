RamenJS supports the following Segment methods:

* `identify`
* `group`
* `track` 
* `page`

### Installation methods

Click the 'Install via Segment' button on the _Getting Started_ page of your
Ramen Organization.

Wait a couple minutes, and then head over to your application and
navigate to a page where Segment's `analytics.js` is installed.
After refreshing the page a few times, refresh this page and you
should see that RamenJS is receiving data.

### Enable Secure Mode **<small>(Optional)</small>**

Once you've verified Ramen is enabled, you may want to enable Secure Mode.

**Secure Mode** ensures that nobody can pretend to be your customers. Enabling
**Secure Mode** requires some changes that a developer will have to make in your
Segment.com `analytics.js` code.
