# Customization

## Icon
```javascript
_ramen.boot("kadjf89383hr89", {
  bug_image_url: "https://thecatapi.com/api/images/get?format=src"
});
```

The RamenJS popups were designed to be minimal so that
they would Just Look Goodâ„¢ on any webpage. The style
of the popups cannot be modified, but the icon, the
little green Ramen 'R', can be chanaged.
