# Customization

## Icon
```html
<script>
  window.ramenSettings = {
    organization_id: "lkadjf89383hr89",
    user: {
      id: "903849h",
      name: "Bugs Bunny",
      email: "ryan+bugs@ramen.is",
      bug_image_url: "https://thecatapi.com/api/images/get?format=src"
    }
  };
</script>
```

The RamenJS popups were designed to be minimal so that
they would Just Look Goodâ„¢ on any webpage. The style
of the popups cannot be modified, but the icon, the
little green Ramen 'R' can be chanaged.
